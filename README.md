# Experimental Robotics Laboratory: Third assignment

## Introduction
ROS package that simulates a simple investigation similar to Cluedo. It uses smach for the state machine behavior and moveit to move the arm so that the camera can retrieve the hints from the arucos.

## Software Architecture
The assignment is divided in five packages:
1) **exproblab_ass3:** Main part of the assignment, it is the only package that I implemented from scratch
2) **moveit_ass3_pkg:** Package built with moveit_setup_assistant
3) **exp_assignment3:** Package provided by the prof, only few modifications have been done to this package
4) **erl2:** Package provided by the prof, no modifications have been done to this package
5) **aruco_ros:** Package for arucos recognition

### Component Diagram
In the diagram below you can see all the nodes necessary for the correct functioning of the code *smach_viewer* is not there as it is only useful for displaying the states while the code is running (so it is not necessary but optional).

* **move_arm:** It provides a service to use moveit and move the arm.
* **marker_publisher:** It continuosly publishes on the topic `/new_hints` the markers ID.
* **oracle(simulation.cpp):** Professor's node, it provide two services: `/oracle_hint` and `/oracle_solution`.
* **move_base & gmapping:** Methods for SLAM(*Simultaneous localization and mapping*).
* **FSM:** It implements a finite state machine that simulates the investigation using smach.
* **SIMULATION:** This component represents all nodes and interfaces of the simulation like gazebo and rviz.

### State Diagram
Here below you can see the state machine diagram generated with smach_viewer.

* **INITIALIZE:** Move the arm to the proper configuration for moving the robot.
* **GOTO_WAYPOINT:** Use the move_base action to control the robot through the rooms. 
* **SEARCH_HINTS:** Move your arm with predefined movements to explore the room.
* **CHECK_NEW_HYPOTHESES:** Check if I have new consistent hypotheses to be tested.
* **TRY_HYPOTHESES:** Move the robot to the center of the map and check my consistent hypotheses. 


### Temporal Diagram

In the diagram below you can see the behavior of the code over time.
Depending on where the clues to the correct hypothesis are, the investigation can take very different times. You may need to visit only one room or, in the worst case, you may need to do more than one waypoint tour.

### List of msgs and srvs
#### msgs
* **Twist:** to publish on cmd_vel the speeds and control the robot
* **Pose:** subscribe to odom and know the current position of the turtle
* **MoveBaseActionGoal:** to set the goal of the move_base action service
* **actionlib_msgs/GoalID:** to cancel the goal of the move_base action service
* **int32:** used by `/marker_publisher`

### srvs
* **exproblab_ass3/Move_arm:** This service allows the robot arm to be moved in any configuration. It takes as input 5 floats each representing the angle of one of the 5 joints.
* **erl2/Oracle:** Used by the service `/oracle_solution`
* **exp_assignment3/Marker:** Used by the service `/oracle_hint`

## Installation and running procedure

### Requirements
To use this code some external modules are needed:
* moveit
* smach
* move_base 
* gmapping

### Installation
You have to install all the required modules mentioned earlier, you can do it using the usual command in the terminal: 
```
sudo apt-get install ros-<ros distribution you are using>-<module>
```

After you installed all the requirements you just need to clone this repository in your ros workspace:
```
git clone https://github.com/LorenzoCausa/ass3_causa
```

**Note:** If you already have some of the packages from this repository, please delete those and not the ones in this repo as some changes have been made to some of these packages. 

### Running procedure
If the package and requirements have been installed correctly, the execution procedure is simple. 
1) Open a terminal and launch:
```
roslaunch exproblab_ass3 robot_in_the_map.launch 2>/dev/null
```
Which will launch the simulation and all the services needed

**Note:** `2>/dev/null` Allows you to avoid the terminal full of warning messages 

2) Open a second terminal and start the state machine node:
```
rosrun exproblab_ass3 FSM.py
```

## Modifications on provided packages
Few changes have been made to the packages provided to facilitate interfacing 

### Modification on exp_assignment3/src/simulation.cpp
The marker_publisher often misinterprets arucos and finds markerIDs that don't match any hints, to make the service robust to a bad request an *exception* has been set for when the markerID is out of bounds [11,40].

### Modification on aruco_ros/src/marker_publish.cpp
The marker publisher has been changed to publish the markerIDs found on the topic `/new_hints`

## Video demo 
If you run properly the code you should see something like this:

**Note:** 
* The video shows only a portion of the entire 'investigation' as it usually lasts quite a long time.
* Both GIF and video have been accelerated to make them shorter and with less downtime.
