R\+OS package that simulates a simple investigation similar to Cluedo. It uses smach for the state machine behavior and moveit to move the arm so that the camera can retrieve the hints from the arucos.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Software Architecture}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}
The assignment is divided in five packages\+: 1) {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceexproblab__ass3}{exproblab\+\_\+ass3}}\+:}} Main part of the assignment, it is the only package that I implemented from scratch 2) {\bfseries{moveit\+\_\+ass3\+\_\+pkg\+:}} Package built with moveit\+\_\+setup\+\_\+assistant 3) {\bfseries{exp\+\_\+assignment3\+:}} Package provided by the prof, only few modifications have been done to this package 4) {\bfseries{erl2\+:}} Package provided by the prof, no modifications have been done to this package 5) {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{namespacearuco__ros}{aruco\+\_\+ros}}\+:}} Package for arucos recognition\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{Component Diagram}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}
In the diagram below you can see all the nodes necessary for the correct functioning of the code {\itshape smach\+\_\+viewer} is not there as it is only useful for displaying the states while the code is running (so it is not necessary but optional).




\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{namespacemove__arm}{move\+\_\+arm}}\+:}} It provides a service to use moveit and move the arm.
\item {\bfseries{marker\+\_\+publisher\+:}} It continuosly publishes on the topic {\ttfamily /new\+\_\+hints} the markers ID.
\item {\bfseries{oracle(simulation.\+cpp)\+:}} Professor\textquotesingle{}s node, it provide two services\+: {\ttfamily /oracle\+\_\+hint} and {\ttfamily /oracle\+\_\+solution}.
\item {\bfseries{move\+\_\+base \& gmapping\+:}} Methods for S\+L\+AM({\itshape Simultaneous localization and mapping}).
\item {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_f_s_m}{F\+SM}}\+:}} It implements a finite state machine that simulates the investigation using smach.
\item {\bfseries{S\+I\+M\+U\+L\+A\+T\+I\+ON\+:}} This component represents all nodes and interfaces of the simulation like gazebo and rviz.

\item {\bfseries{T\+R\+Y\+\_\+\+H\+Y\+P\+O\+T\+H\+E\+S\+ES\+:}} Move the robot to the center of the map and check my consistent hypotheses.

In the diagram below you can see the behavior of the code over time. Depending on where the clues to the correct hypothesis are, the investigation can take very different times. You may need to visit only one room or, in the worst case, you may need to do more than one waypoint tour.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsection{List of msgs and srvs}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}

If the package and requirements have been installed correctly, the execution procedure is simple. 1) Open a terminal and launch\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{roslaunch exproblab\_ass3 robot\_in\_the\_map.launch 2>/dev/null}
\end{DoxyCode}


Which will launch the simulation and all the services needed

{\bfseries{Note\+:}} {\ttfamily 2$>$/dev/null} Allows you to avoid the terminal full of warning messages

2) Open a second terminal and start the state machine node\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}

{\bfseries{Note\+:}} Both G\+IF and video have been accelerated to make them shorter and with less downtime.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md20}{}\doxysection{Environment and working hypothesis}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md20}
The system is designed to be robust and flexible. The program is in fact independent both from the map and from the arrangement of the aruco, with very few modifications it is also possible to modify the waypoints and the number of rooms and hypotheses.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md21}{}\doxysubsection{System\textquotesingle{}s features}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md21}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item move\+\_\+base + gmapping for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (S\+L\+AM)
\item moveable arm trough moveit equipped with camera
\item laser scanner for sensing the enviroment
\item the robot explores the rooms in order only on the first lap, after completing it it moves randomly between the waypoints. In this way, any aruco that was not recognized on the first round have the possibility of being recognized later thanks to a behavior that differs from the first time.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md22}{}\doxysubsection{Systemâ€™s limitations}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md22}
The main problem with the system lies in the recognition of the aruco. The robot has great difficulty in recognizing aruco that are not very close to the waypoints. If the correct hypothesis contains I\+Ds of these aruco the robot may not be able to find the solution after the first waypoint round, in this case the robot will start spinning randomly in the map. Generally it still manages to find the solution but the process tends to take a very long time(hours). There are several possible solutions to the problem which are addressed in the {\itshape improvements} section.

{\bfseries{Note\+:}} The system takes a long time to complete the first lap as well. On my Linux computer, for example, it takes about 50 minutes, while on the same computer in Docker it takes too long to test due to the slow simulation (it worked below 5 fps).\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md23}{}\doxysubsection{Improvements}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md23}
There are several solutions to the aforementioned limitations but they all cost something of the system.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md24}{}\doxysubsubsection{solution1\+: Adding waypoints.}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md24}
The first possible solution is to add waypoints for larger rooms near the arucos which remain difficult to recognize. This solution is very fast to implement but would make the system dependent on the arrangement of the aruco (as well as even slower).\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md25}{}\doxysubsubsection{solution2\+: Move the arucos.}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md25}
A second solution would be to move the aruco near the waypoints. This solution is obviously not very good as the simulation is modified, facilitating the starting problem. {\bfseries{Note\+:}} In the folder $\ast$ exp\+\_\+assignment3 / worlds $\ast$ you can find (in addition to the standard version {\itshape assignment.\+world}) also a version with the arucos slightly moved to speed up the investigation ({\itshape my\+\_\+world.\+world}), this version was used for the above video .\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md26}{}\doxysubsubsection{solution3\+: Wall follow.}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md26}
A final solution is to add a wall follow part in the state S\+E\+A\+R\+C\+H\+\_\+\+H\+I\+N\+TS. In this way, for each room the robot in addition to inspecting with the usual arm movements, would also make the circumscription (keeping the camera facing the wall) of the perimeter of the room. This solution solves the problem of distant arucos, but makes the patrol of the single room terribly slow.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md27}{}\doxysection{Doxygen documentation}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md27}
